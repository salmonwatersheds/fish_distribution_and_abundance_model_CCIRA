# CCIRA project

Coordinated by the Pacific Salmon Foundation in support of salmon restoration work by Heiltsuk, Kitasoo Xaiâ€™xais, Nuxalk, and Wuikinuxv Nations, these scripts adapt fish distribution / abundance models developed for the Haida Gwaii by [Gowgaia (2009)](https://salmonwatersheds.ca/document/lib_465/) to the CCIRA study area using current tools, methods and data.


## Method

1. Determine BC Freshwater Atlas watershed groups present within the study area: `ATNA,BELA,KHTZ,KITL,KLIN,KTSU,LDEN,LRDO,NASC,NECL,NIEL,OWIK`

2. Reference Pacific Salmon Explorer known spawning streams to BC Freshwater Atlas stream network and load to `bcfishpass`, discarding modelled natural barriers downstream of known habitat

3. Perform basic QA checks of observations and barriers present in study area from all sources

4. Generate three [`bcfishpass` access models](https://smnorris.github.io/bcfishpass/02_model_access.html) using these natural barrier assumptions:

    - Salmon (CH/CM/CO/PK/SK): falls >5m, subsurface flow, 15% gradient for >= 100m
    - Steelhead (ST): falls >5m, subsurface flow, 20% gradient for >= 100m
    - Resident (CT/DV/RB): falls >5m, subsurface flow, 25% gradient for >= 100m

5. Extend the `bcfishpass` accessibility model with the Gowgaia stream classifications:

    #### Anadromous (CH/CM/CO/PK/SK)

    - `KNOWN` fish presence: stream downstream of known observation(s) for given species
    - `INFERRED` fish presence: stream upstream of known observations and downstream of known/modelled barriers
    - `POTENTIAL` anadromous fish presence: unsurveyed streams from stream mouth to first known/modelled barrier

    #### Resident (CT/DV/RB)

    - `KNOWN` fish presence: stream downstream of known observation(s) for given species
    - `INFERRED` fish presence: stream upstream of known observations and downstream of known/modelled barriers
    - `POTENTIAL` resident fish presence: unsurveyed streams from stream mouth to first known/modelled barrier and below the elevation of the highest observation of the species in the study area
    - `POTENTIAL_BARRIER_DNSTR` all stream upstream of known/modelled barriers, not downstream of observations, and below the elevation of the highest observation of the species in the study area

    Elevation maximums:

    - `CT`: 1508m
    - `DV`: 1005m
    - `RB`: 1831m

6. Extend the above fish accessibility model with an adaptation of the Gowgaia abundance classification:

    #### Anadromous

    For all `KNOWN`,`INFERRED`,`POTENTIAL` streams, classify as follows:

    - `FEW_SALMON`: magnitude < 5
    - `SOME_SALMON`: magnitude >= 5, < 40
    - `MANY_SALMON`: magnitude >= 40
    - `MOST_SALMON`: where a stream is noted as a top ten producer in the NuSEDS data for any given salmon species

    #### Resident

    For streams modelled as inaccessible to salmon:

    - `RESIDENT_FISH_ONLY`: streams with no known/modelled barrier to resident fish downstream
    - `RESIDENT_FISH_ONLY_BARRIER_DNSTR`: streams with known/modelled barrier to resident fish downstream

    Output dataset includes the column `upstream_area_ha` to enable further adjustments to this classification. Note that `upstream_area_ha` includes all watersheds upstream of a stream with a given watershed code, but does *not* include the area of the watershed(s) having the equivalent watershed code as the stream.


## Setup

Install the following tools (for the August 2023 deliverable, the noted versions were used - scripts may have to be adjusted if running with the latest dependencies):

- [`fwapg`](https://github.com/smnorris/fwapg) : [v0.5.1]
- [`bcfishobs`](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishobs) : [v0.1.3]
- [`bcfishpass`](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass) : [v0.1.dev5]


## Run scripts

1. Build the `bcfishpass` database using the [CCIRA parameters](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/tree/main/parameters/example_ccira) and generate these access models for the above noted watershed groups (see instructions in `bcfishpass`):

    - [salmon](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/blob/main/model/access/sql/model_access_ch_cm_co_pk_sk.sql)
    - [resident](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/blob/main/model/access/sql/model_access_ct_dv_rb.sql)
    - [steelhead](https://github.com/smnorris/bcfishpass/blob/main/model/access/sql/model_access_st.sql)

2. Process NuSEDS, apply the Gowgaia model and generate deliverables:

        ./ccira.sh


Model output is dumped to `/outputs/ccira.gpkg.zip`
Streams with abundance upgraded to `MOST_SALMON` based on NuSEDs productivity ranking (and their original, magnitude based abundance values) are noted in [upgraded_streams.csv](upgraded_streams.csv)
